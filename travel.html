                <p>Cancún, a Mexican city on the Yucatán Peninsula bordering the Caribbean Sea, is known for its beaches, numerous resorts and energetic nightlife. It's composed of 2 distinct areas: the more traditional downtown area, El Centro, and Zona Hotelera, a long, beachfront strip of high-rise hotels, nightclubs, shops and restaurants.</p>

The Mexican government invested $71 million US Dollars in the project, which restored 11 kilometers of the area's beaches. Cancun's beaches have white sand, which is made from crushed coral and is not hot to the touch</p>
